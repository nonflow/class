# test_runner.py Documentation

## Overview
`test_runner.py` is a Python script that contains unit tests for the `runner.py` module. It uses the `unittest` framework to test various functions and the main execution flow of the runner script.

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to ensure the correct functionality of the `runner.py` module by testing its individual components and the overall execution flow. It helps maintain the reliability and correctness of the command runner system.

## Main Components

1. `TestRunner` class:
   - This is the main test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - It contains several test methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `runner.py` module.

2. Test methods:
   - `test_load_yaml()`: Tests the YAML loading functionality.
   - `test_list_classes_and_objects()`: Tests the dynamic class and object listing.
   - `test_execute_command()`: Tests the command execution functionality.
   - `test_main()`: Tests the main execution flow of the runner script.

## Test Cases

1. `test_load_yaml()`:
   - Mocks the file opening process.
   - Tests if the `load_yaml()` function correctly parses a simple YAML structure.

2. `test_list_classes_and_objects()`:
   - Mocks the module importing process.
   - Checks if the function correctly identifies and lists classes and methods from the mocked modules.

3. `test_execute_command()`:
   - Creates a mock class and object structure.
   - Tests if the `execute_command()` function correctly calls the specified method and prints the result.

4. `test_main()`:
   - Mocks the command-line arguments, YAML loading, and class listing processes.
   - Tests the overall flow of the `main()` function, including command execution and output printing.

## Usage
To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
python -m unittest test_runner.py
```

## Dependencies
- unittest: Python's built-in testing framework.
- unittest.mock: For creating mock objects and patching functions during testing.
- sys: For manipulating command-line arguments in tests.
- io: For capturing stdout in tests.

## Notes
- The tests use extensive mocking to isolate the functionality of `runner.py` and avoid dependencies on actual file systems or module imports.
- The `patch` decorator is used to mock various functions and objects, allowing for controlled testing environments.
- The tests cover both successful scenarios and error handling in the `runner.py` module.

## Importance
These unit tests are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the `runner.py` module. They help catch potential bugs introduced by code changes and ensure that the core functionality of the command runner system remains intact across updates and modifications.
